        <p>By default, list items are displayed vertically. In this example we use display: inline-block to display them horizontally (side by side).</p>

        <!--inline-block treats the element like other inline elements but allows the use of block properties.
             Elements with display: block take up as much width as they are allowed and typically start on a new line -->
